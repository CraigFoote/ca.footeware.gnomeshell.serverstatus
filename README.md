# serverstatus@footeware.ca

A GNOME Shell extension with an indicator in the task bar displaying status of entered web server URLs using emojis: 

![server.svg](assets/server.svg) initializing...

![server-down.svg](assets/server-down.svg) server down/unresponsive 

![server-bad.svg](assets/server-bad.svg) malformed URL

![server-up.svg](assets/server-up.svg) server up and responding

---

The task bar shows the worst status from the set of all server statuses in the popup menu. Server down is considered worse than bad URL.

To customize, the four **.svg** files in the **assets** folder can be swapped out with your own icons. Just keep the same filenames.
