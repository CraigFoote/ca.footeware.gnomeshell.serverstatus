# serverstatus@footeware.ca

A GNOME Shell extension with an indicator in the task bar displaying status of entered web server URLs using emojis: 

![](assets/server.svg) initializing...

![](assets/server-down.svg) server down/unresponsive 

![](assets/server-bad.svg) malformed URL

![](assets/server-up.svg) server up and responding

The task bar shows the worst status from the set of all server statuses in the popup menu. Server down is considered worse than bad URL.
